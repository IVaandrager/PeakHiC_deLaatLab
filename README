The peakHiC_pipeline folder contains all the scripts necessary for running peakHiC. 
The pipeline is called from the peakHiC_pipeline_iwan.R, which needs the HiC reads data, in silico digestion fragments of your restriction enzyme, viewpoints as specified with the GenomeObj_creation.R and any further RNA expression data or protein/histone ChIP. 
This script takes a long time to run.

After this you can use the generated StatObj for any statistical inquiries, which hold a large amount of information on the loops.
All these loops and viewpoints can be visualised by the plot script plot_V4C_vpID.R, based on the vpIDs specified in the GenomeObj.

I performed a systematic statistical analysis using TAD_BW_analysis.R for which I use the distinctions.R script to specify categories of loops to investigate.
Manual statistical queries were performed with loop_statistics.R and also contain many of the figures, this was an exploratory script. 

The extra file contains some scripts on processing ChIP information and RNA seq data to be included to the statObj later on, through the statObj_creation script as part of the pipeline.

Much of the scripts in the peakHiC_pipeline are originally created by Geert Geeven and Valerio Bianchi, please do not use the pipeline without acknowledging them.

The data is not on github as it are too large files, data can be requested or retrieved from GEO as described in my thesis.
